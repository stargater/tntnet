Put your actions here.

Actions are json requests, which do not expect an reply other than success or error.

They have the file extension `.ecpp`. Typically they start with a Tag `<%cpp>`
and end with the closing tag `</%cpp>`. On error they throw an exception or
return a proper http error code.

From your java script code they are accessed using the js method
`tntnet.action`. The url is the path to the action code without `action` and the
extension.

Example:

    tntnet.action(
        'process/activate',        // calls the action `action/process/activate.ecpp`
        { processId: 47 },         // a parameter
        function(data, textStatus, jqXHR) {  // optionally a function, which is called on success
            information("Process activated");
        },
        function(data, textStatus, jqXHR) {  // optionally a function, which is called on failure
            error("Failed to activate process: " + data);
        });
